## Features

**Homepage Product List** - Displays a comprehensive list of products, featuring images, name and price.

**Dynamic Product Details** - Each product has a detailed page for more information, including description, and images.

**Filters for different types of products** - See a list and filter by all latest, category and price.

**Responsive Design** - Fully responsive, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable browsing experience on any device.

**Server-side Rendering** - This site leverages NextJS server side rendering for faster load times and greater user experience.

**ShadCN components** - Highly customisable pre built components are featured throught the app.

## Design Patterns

**Maintainability** - I have tried to keep components modular and scalable and dynamic, with an emphasis on reusability and readability.

**Server fetching and formatting** - I am handling fetching and formatting of data on the backend, allowing for tsx components to render data without unnecessary logic or formatting on the front end. I have achieved this by creating dynamic helper functions that process and reformat the data.

**Dynamic fetch function** - I have created two highly flexible server functions to handle all the data fetching necessary for the application.

**Type Safety** - The use of types and interfaces is constant throughout the app, without a single use of the word 'any' to override the type check.

**File and folder structure** - The app is organised to seperate components based on their role, as well as separating types, utils, server functions and constants.

**Saving and committing work often** - I regularly made commits and pull requests to github using a total of 36 pull requests with clear commit messages. This keeps the project organised and allows me to work on tasks without altering the main codebase.

## How SEO was handled

**Static Metadata** - The root metadata defines a default title template ("%s | Razzy Store"), a descriptive summary of the store, relevant keywords, and directives for search engines to index and follow links.

**Dynamic Metadata** - On product pages, metadata is dynamically generated by fetching the product's title and description from the backend, ensuring each page has unique and relevant content for better search engine rankings.
